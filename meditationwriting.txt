From Chaos to Clarity


When you decide you no longer want your mind to control you, you are ready for meditation.
Truly getting to this point is difficult for many, mainly becuase you have to really be
fed up with your situation before you start seeking answers. 
The main tenent of meditation is focus. Meditation is active focus. While meditating
you focus on an object and nothing else.  As you meditate, you attention will naturally wander
onto other objects or thoughts, it is your job to bring your attention back to your object of focus.
many meditation practices use the breath as the object of focus and for good reason. Since you are always
inhaling, exhaling or at a slight pause between the two, it is an easy thing to bring your focus on.  
Vipasana meditation is based around breath awareness.

The difference between attention, awareness and focus.

Focus is directing your attention onto a single object, thought or situation. Awareness is the ability to recognize
objects, thoughts and situations. Attention is directed awareness, focus is directed attention.  The difference is subtle but
it is there.  Focus is training your attention to remain on an object (and in turn remaining singly aware of your object at the
exclusion of all else).

Where to begin

You have to start somewhere. With meditation the only way to make progress is to practice.
You can read, watch or study about meditation and become an expert on the subject but without practicing
you will never develop your own capabilities.
